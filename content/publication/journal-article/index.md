abstract: This study presents three methods for predicting swing hip kinematics during trip recovery, including a Gaussian process regression (GPR) model, a time-series neural network model, and a pendulum dynamics model. The research aims to develop predictive models that can help assistive robotic devices safely aid individuals during unexpected motion disturbances.

summary: Developed predictive models for swing hip kinematics during trip recovery to enhance safety in assistive robotic devices.
